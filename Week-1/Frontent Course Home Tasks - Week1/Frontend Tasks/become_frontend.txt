I want to become a front-end developer because I enjoy creating visually appealing 
and interactive websites that provide a smooth and engaging user experience. 
Front-end development allows me to combine creativity with technical skills, bringing 
ideas to life through design and code. I am fascinated by how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
work together to create responsive and dynamic interfaces that people can easily interact with. 
By mastering front-end technologies, I can build projects that are not only functional but also 
aesthetically pleasing, making the digital world more accessible and enjoyable for everyone.
